Steps involved in the deploying the ML model:-


1) Understanding the Time-Series data 

2) Clean and Process Time-Series data

3) After processing, we conclude that 'WindSpeed' variable is highly correlated with the target variable: 'ActivePower'
 
4) Implement Extreme Gradient Boosting and train model using the one feature

5) Deploy the model as a flask webapp
