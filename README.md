1) Understanding Time-Series data 

2) Clean and Process Time-Series data

3) After processing, we conclude that 'WindSpeed' variable is highly correlated with the target variable: 'ActivePower'
 
4) Implement Extreme Gradient Boosting and train model using the one feature

5) Deploy the model as a flask webapp

Dataset - 30 months of windmill turbine data, recorded at 10 mins interval

Goal - Predicting Active Wind Power using the dataset
